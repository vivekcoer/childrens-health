bundle install
bundle exec [--keep-file-descriptors] command

rails new childrens-health-api --api
rails g model children_treatment name url:string --force
rails db:migrate

bin/rails g migration CreateChildrenDiseasesChildrenSymptomsJoinTable

when rails db:reset or rake db:reset complains about open connections
-->
REVOKE CONNECT ON DATABASE thedb FROM public;
(and possibly other users/roles; see \l+ in psql)

You can then terminate all connections to this db except your own:

get PIDs from this query 

SELECT pid, pg_terminate_backend(pid) 
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE datname = current_database() AND pid <> pg_backend_pid();
-> now opn psql console and kill -9 <pid>

-> make sure to shut down pg4admin or any other postgres client (this client keeps 1 open connection and hence doesn't let
reset to work)

now rails db:reset should work!


V.Good on db annotations!

Reverse Proxy ngrok (I have downloaded and unzipped it inside my Applications folder)
# cd into your local bin directory
cd /usr/local/bin

# create symlink
ln -s /Applications/ngrok ngrok

added this optional token so that my tunnel can run for longer
ngrok authtoken 6ZF1nV1nPkc6QZPoBNkHy_5ze1F9ezCP9YCNV2yb6RS

finally listen to port on 5000
ngrok http 5000
